# R-project-restaurant-waiting-list
In a Kolkata based-cloud kitchen ,which generally operates from
evening 6pm to morning 6am .These orders are placed through fastdelivery
apps like zomato, swiggy .Generally, the cloud-kitchen gets
an arrival notice of 7 orders per hour which follows exponential
distribution and each orders gets 6 minutes takes to get ready which
follows exponential distribution . At regular-pace, after 9 minutes a
delivery partners comes to pick up the orders. For simplicity of
question, here we consider there are two teams who are handling the
delivery of the food to the riders and who are making the orders
.Also, we assume sufficient amount of chefs are present to make the
orders .so, the overlapping of time do not create any problem .Using,
simulation process we will see how much is orders can be taken
between the opening time period to run the cloud-kitchen properly.
